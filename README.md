# AttestEd

AttestEd Self-learning NFT accreditation validated by community

THE PROBLEM • Lack of Recognized Proof: Informal learning (YouTube, coding bootcamps) often lacks accredited proof. • Trust Issues: Employers and other parties may not trust self-reported skills. • Barrier to Skill Verification: Current certification systems can be costly or inaccessible.

THE SOLUTION • Community-Validated Credentials: Skill-based NFTs backed by community endorsements. • Accessible Learning Proof: No centralized institution, lower barriers for skill verification. • Decentralized Trust: Proof of skills stored on the blockchain, making credentials verifiable and transferable.
